# Create_Desktop_Shortcuts
PowerShell script that can be used to create url shortcuts on the desktop.

## Use Case
It is becoming more common for clients to be utilizing cloud/web apps.  As such I have found that being able to create the necessary shortcuts to various cloud/web resources has been helpful for clients, as many are more comfortable with desktop shortcuts over using the browser favorites bar especially when that fills up.
